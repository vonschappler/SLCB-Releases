[Custom SFX] Streamlabs Chatbot Script

This is a Streamlabs Chatbot Python Script, made by a request to [NulliferBones](http://twitch.tv/nulliferbones).

This script enables multiple sound effects trigger with a single call and this version can be controlled by a dashboard made using [Electron.js](http://electronjs.org)
and other tools used to make Electron.js desktop applications.
